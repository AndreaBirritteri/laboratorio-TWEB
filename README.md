# Booking Website for Private Lessons

Developed a fully functional, Dockerized web application that allows users to book private lessons. The application was built using Java Servlets for the backend, Vue.js for the frontend, and MySQL for the database.

Backend: Developed a Java Servlet linked to a MySQL database. Implemented features such as user authentication and lesson booking. Handled challenges related to data consistency and reliability.
Frontend: Created a single-page application using Vue.js. Implemented features such as dynamic page updates, form validation, and user-friendly error messages. Focused on creating a responsive and intuitive user interface.
Dockerization: Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring a consistent environment for development, testing, and deployment. This led to a reduction in environment-related issues and improved the efficiency of the development process.
